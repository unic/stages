Stages, ultra flexible and relatively lightweight wizard and form components for React

**Stages is currently not production ready! The API will most likely slightly change before v1 release. Use at your own risk. However, we here at Unic already do use it with success in multiple big client projects.**

- [Demos (WIP)](https://stages-demo.vercel.app/)
- [Docs (WIP)](https://stages-docs.vercel.app/)

## Possible Usecases:

- Forms (one stage)
- Wizards (multiple stages, linear progression)
- Dynamic Wizard (multiple dynamic stages, non linear progression)
- Text Adventure (multiple stages, free progression)
- Quiz (One or multiple stages, with custom validation and locked fields)
- Accordion Form (stages rendered inside an accordion)
- Slideshow (multiple stages, no validation, keyboard navigation)
- Router (for SPAs)

## Installation

Installation:

`npm i react-stages --save`
