# Stages Documentation

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Stages is currently not production ready! The API will probably slightly change before v1 release. Use at your own risk.
</Callout>

Stages is a form and wizard tool made for highly complex and dynamic usecases. It can however be used easily for simple 
forms, as well.

> There are many wizard and form libraries out there so why should you choose this one? This wizard is different. 
No styles. No fixed layouts. Not even fixed behaviour! You want to put your wizard steps into an accordion? Go 
for it! You want to jump back to step 2 after step 4 and then display slightly different data based on data added 
on step 3? Go for it! You want a step with zero input fields, one that just displays information? Go for it! You don’t 
even want to build a wizard but a quiz which tells you how many questions you’ve got right? Go for it! You finally want a 
slideshow where all slides fit into your set duration? You can build it with Stages! You have such a complicated project 
that everything is custom? No ballast with this one! No styles to overwrite! This wizard is different because it makes 
building complicated things simple, by combining a few well thought out simple, but super flexible building blocks without 
pressing you into a corset of limitations. It’s meant to build wizards, but it can be used to build a thousand other things 
and make those things great with little effort.

Note: Since v0.4.0 Stages is now using a path based system, so no more limitis on how nested you can structure your data.
