# Stages Documentation

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Stages is currently not production ready! The API will most likely slightly change before v1 release. Use at your own risk. However, 
  we here at Unic already do use it with success in multiple big client projects.
</Callout>

Stages is a form and wizard tool made for highly complex and dynamic usecases. It can however be used easily for simple 
forms, as well.

> There are many wizard and form libraries out there so why should you choose this one? This wizard is different. 
No styles. No fixed layouts. Not even fixed behaviour! You want to put your wizard steps into an accordion? Go 
for it! You want to jump back to step 2 after step 4 and then display slightly different data based on data added 
on step 3? Go for it! You want a step with zero input fields, one that just displays information? Go for it! You don’t 
even want to build a wizard but a quiz which tells you how many questions you’ve got right? Go for it! You finally want a 
slideshow where all slides fit into your set duration? You can build it with Stages! You have such a complicated project 
that everything is custom? No ballast with this one! No styles to overwrite! This wizard is different because it makes 
building complicated things simple, by combining a few well thought out simple, but super flexible building blocks without 
pressing you into a corset of limitations. It’s meant to build wizards and highly dynamic forms, but it can be used to build 
a thousand other things and make those things great with little effort.

Note: Since v0.4.0 Stages is now using a path based approach, which removes any limitis on how deeply nested you can structure your data.

## Possible Usecases:

- Forms (one stage)
- Wizards (multiple stages, linear progression)
- Dynamic Wizard (multiple dynamic stages, non linear progression)
- Text Adventure (multiple stages, free progression)
- Quiz (One or multiple stages, with custom validation and locked fields)
- Accordion Form (stages rendered inside an accordion)
- Slideshow (multiple stages, no validation, keyboard navigation)
- Router (for SPAs)

## Roadmap to v1

- All callbacks take an object, no exceptions! They can either be named `onX` for events or `handleX` for actions
- `transform` property replaces filter and cleanUp, and can have dependencies. A new `then` property can be used to then revalidate other fields
- `validate` property replaces `customValidation`, `regexValidation` and `validateOn` (With `on`, `check` and `then` options. Path in then array can have wildcards)
- `compute` replaces `computedOptions` and `computedValues` and can have dependencies (fields to watch for changes)
- `value` property replaces `defaultValue`, `isInterfaceState` etc.
- `options` property which replaces both dynamic and computed options
- Add fluid API options wherever it makes sense (string, object and function as options)
- All boolean options must start with is: isRequired, isDisabled …
- Add random in front of an option and it is an array, and it will be chosen randomly from the array, for example `randomPlaceholder: ["text1", "text2"]`
- Fields objects will have a new `props` property, which tells Stages exactly which properties to map to the field. The mappings can have functions to convert between field component and Staged. Stages will warn if a required prop is missing.
- Fields object each has an optional `transform` prop to transform the value going to the component and coming back, so you can make any component work with Stages
- Each field prop function gets an object with: data, path, config
- Configure when to call the Forms `onChange`, for example only on data change, but not error change or interface data change
- Replace `data` property on callbacks with `value`, and `allData` with `data`
- Nested configs can be set (or overwritten in the case of `fieldConfigs`) with paths like: `"validation.render": ...`
- Combine `fieldSets` and `filedConfigs` into one which can do both, so basically the render function can be optional or if it’s just a function, that it’s one field.
- In the forms render function, combine `actionProps` and `fieldProps` and remove duplicates. No need to nest them as people can select which ones they need. Rename some if needed.
- Make it possible to repopulate undo data (for example to use server saved version history)
- Collection actions can trigger revalidation of all or certain fields inside the same collection
- Expand the autoSave feature to have an option for async server calls
- Name the global form config `globals` and put `validateOn` and other global configs in there
- Improve logging and the Debugger component (Chrome extension?)

### New API proposal for field validations:

```
validation: {
  allowedChars: "^[A-Z0-9]*$",
  phone: ({ data }) => {
    return true;
  },
  swissPhone: {
    on: ["change","blur"],
    check: ({ data }) => {
      return true;
    },
    then: ["field2", "group1.input4", "group.*"]
  },
  render: ({ errorCode }) => { return <>Test</> }
}
```

### New API proposal for field value transforms:

```
transform: [
  {
    on: "change",
    fn: ({ data }) => {
      return capitalize(data);
    },
    then: {
      field2: [
        "clear",
        "validate",
        ({ data }) => {
          if (data === "") return "clear";
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    on: ["blur", "action"],
    fn: ({ data }) => {
      return data.trim();
    }
  }
]
```

### New API proposal for the fields object:

```
{
	text: {
		component: Input,
		validate: defaultValidation,
		props: ["label", "id", "isRequired", ...]
	},
	longtext: {
		component: Input,
		validate: defaultValidation,
		props: props => ["label", "id", "isRequired", ...props]
	},
	textarea: {
		component: Input,
		validate: defaultValidation,
		props: [
			"label",
			"id:string",
			{isRequired: "required"},
			...
		]
	},
	select: {
		component: Input,
		validate: defaultValidation,
		props: [
			"label",
			"id",
			{
				options: value => {
					return {
						prop: "options",
						value: value.map(item => {
							return {
								value: item.val,
								text: item.name
							};
						})
					};
				}
			},
			...
		]
	},
	date: {
		component: Input,
		validate: defaultValidation,
		transform: {
			in: data => new Date(data),
			out: data => string(data)
		}
	}
}
```
