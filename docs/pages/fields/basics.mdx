# Basics

Forms are made out of fields. The idea is that you bring your own fields, but there's a plain fieldset 
you can start with. This is how you include the plain fieldset:

```
import { Form, plainFields as fields } from "react-stages";

...

<Form
    fields={fields}
    ...
/>
```

We plan to release complete fieldsets in the future for popular component libraries and if you create a nice fieldset, 
please let us know and we'll link to it from here.
