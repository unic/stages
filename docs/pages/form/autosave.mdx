# Auto Save

You can tell Stages to auto save the added data. The data is either stored in local or session storage. 
On all reset actions, the saved data is removed.

You can enable it two ways. The basic way is to either set `local` or `session` like this:

```
<Form
    autoSave="local"
    ...
/>
```

Or if you want to config this option more precisely, you can do it like this:

```
<Form
    autoSave={{
		type: "session",
		validDataOnly: false
	}}
    ...
/>
```

Options are:

- **type**: The storage type, either `local` or `session`
- **validDataOnly**: Should only valid data be saved? (boolean)
