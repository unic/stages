# Configs

The `config` property is an object which has currently two properties:

- **fields**: A function which returns an array of field configurations
- **asyncDataLoader**: A function which returns a promise with data loaded from an API

## Fields Configuration

A field configuration looks something like this:

```
<Form
    config={{
        fields: () => {
            return [
                {
                    id: "email",
                    label: "Email",
                    type: "email",
                    isRequired: true
                },
                {
                    id: "password",
                    label: "Password",
                    type: "password",
                    isRequired: true
                }
            ]
        }
    }}
    ...
/>
```

It's a function because it can be dynamic, based on data you've entered:

```
<Form
    config={{
        fields: (data) => {
            return [
                {
                    id: "email",
                    label: "Email",
                    type: "email",
                    isRequired: !data.isLoggedIn
                },
                {
                    id: "password",
                    label: "Password",
                    type: "password",
                    isRequired: true
                }
            ]
        }
    }}
    ...
/>
```

Each object in the array needs at least this two properties:

- **id**: This defines how the property in the data object is named
- **type**: This is the key of the field type. The field type needs to exist in the fields object, otherwise nothing is rendered.

For accessiibility reasons, you normally have at least another required property, `label`, which adds a label to the field.

Other often used properties:

- **value**: You can set the value directly here. For computed value, use the computedValue prop
- **options**: An array with options for a select or a radio group, usually an object with `value` and `text` props
- **placeholder**: A placeholder for input fields
- **isRequired**: Is the field required? This will be automatically validated for you by the Form component
- **isDisabled**: Is the field disabled? If yes, set it with this property. Normally used for fields with computed values
- **prefix**: A text which is show right before the field, in the same line
- **suffix**: A text which is show right after the field, in the same line
- **secondaryText**: A descriptive text usually shown right below the label

Additionally, Stages comes with a few special properties which are field inependent:

- **errorRenderer**: A custom error renderer, to make errors look nice
- **computedValue**: You can compute a value dynamically based on the current form data
- **filter**: You can filter all user input with a filter function

See the detailed info on those in the respective doc pages.
