# Render

The `render` prop receives the processed fields from the `config` and lets you decide 
how to render them to the user. This could look like this:

```
<Form
    ...
    render={({ actionProps, fieldProps }) => (
        <>
            <div>
                {fieldProps.fields.email}
                <br />
                {fieldProps.fields.password}
            </div>
            <hr />
            <button
                type="button"
                onClick={() => actionProps.handleActionClick(payload => console.log("onSubmit:", payload), true)}
            >
                Submit
            </button>
        </>
    )}
/>
```

You get two render properties which are essentially two collection of properties for two different parts of a form.

- **fieldProps**: This contain the renderer fields, props for handling collections and some additional stuff
    - **fields**: An object of rendered fields where the id is the key of the object
    - **onCollectionAction**: A callback to act on collections, like add a new entry or remove an existing one
    - **data**: The current form data
    - **errors**: The error object, being used mainly for collection errors
    - **asyncData**: All the data loaded from the `asyncDataLoader` function in the config
    - **isDirty**: A boolean which lets you know if the form has edited, dirty, non saved values
    - **dirtyFields**: An object which contains keys for all dirty fields. Object props are `oldValue` and `newValue`
- **actionProps**:
    - **handleActionClick**: A callback to process a form action
    - **isDisabled**: Actions can be disabled, for example if data has to be valid
    - **isDirty**: A boolean which lets you know if the form has edited, dirty, non saved values
    - **dirtyFields**: An object which contains keys for all dirty fields. Object props are `oldValue` and `newValue`
