# Dynamic Fields

Field configurations can be dynamic, based on previously entered data. Here are a few examples:

```
<Form
    config={{
        fields: (data) => {
            return [
                {
                    id: "field1",
                    label: "Field 1",
                    type: "text"
                },
                {
                    id: "field2",
                    label: "Field 2",
                    secondaryText: "This field is only required if Field 1 is populated. Add something to the first field to see this field getting required.",
                    type: "text",
                    isRequired: data.field1
                },
                {
                    id: "field3",
                    label: "Field 3",
                    type: "text"
                },
                {
                    id: "field4",
                    label: "Field 4",
                    secondaryText: "This field is only enabled if Field 3 is populated.",
                    type: "text",
                    isDisabled: !data.field3
                },
                {
                    id: "name",
                    label: "Name",
                    type: "text",
                    isRequired: true
                },
                {
                    id: "age",
                    label: data.name ? `What is the age of ${data.name}?` : "Age",
                    secondaryText: "The label of this field is dynamic.",
                    type: "number"
                }
            ]
        }
    }}
    ...
/>
```

You can do the same in the render function, for example if you want to hide a group of fields if a checkbox above isn't checked:

```
<Form
    render={({ fieldProps }) => (
        <div>
            {fieldProps.fields.myCheckbox}
            <br />
            {fieldProps.data.myCheckbox ? (
                <div>
                    {fieldProps.fields.groupField1}
                    <br />
                    {fieldProps.fields.groupField2}
                    ...
                </div>
            ) : null}
        </div>
    )}
    ...
/>
```

However, be careful to not make a form to dynamic, this can be irritating for the user and hard to test.

## The isRendered prop

To help with dynamic fields, we've added the `isRendered` property. An example:

```
...
{
    id: "myfield",
    label: "My Field",
    type: "text",
    isRendered: (path, data, allData) => {
        if (path.includes("[1]")) return false;
        return true;
    }
},
...
```

This field only renders, if it's in a collection and has an index of `1`, so in other words, if it is the second item 
in a collection. All other items in the collection will not render this field.
