# Basics

The Form component can be used on it's own, or in combination with the Stages component. Used on it's own, 
it is a very feature rich form component.

This is how you use it:

```
import { Form, plainFields as fields } from "react-stages";

<Form
    fields={fields}
    config={{
        fields: () => {
            return [
                {
                    id: "email",
                    label: "Email",
                    type: "email",
                    isRequired: true
                },
                {
                    id: "password",
                    label: "Password",
                    type: "password",
                    isRequired: true
                }
            ]
        }
    }}
    render={({ actionProps, fieldProps }) => (
        <>
            <div>
                {fieldProps.fields.email}
                <br />
                {fieldProps.fields.password}
            </div>
            <hr />
            <button
                type="button"
                onClick={() => actionProps.handleActionClick(payload => console.log("onSubmit:", payload), true)}
            >
                Submit
            </button>
        </>
    )}
/>
```

Looks a little complicated at first, but only because the form component is built for flexibility and doesn't render any components on its own. You have to supply all the components!

## The three main properties

- **fields:** This contains all your field components and default field validation, as a start you can import the plain fields
- **config:** This one expects a function which return an array of field configurations, you need to set at least `id` and `type` on each field
- **render:** The render function is where you take all the processed fields, and output them in whatever layout you desire
