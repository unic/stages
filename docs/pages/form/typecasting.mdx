# Typecasting

Sometimes you have fields which expect a different type than what you want in your data. 
And data should always be serialisable. So for example if you have a calendar input, than that 
date should always be in a string format like this: `2022-08-23`. However, some calendar fields 
may return a Date object, which can cause problems. To solve such cases, you can explicitely 
typecast on a field configuration. This is how:

```
{
    id: "arrivalDate",
    label: "Arrival",
    type: "calendar",
    cast: {
        data: "string",
        field: "date"
    }
}
```

The `cast` option expects two options, one for the type used in the data and one for the type the field expects. 
Both options are required. Additionally, you can supply a callback to do the conversion yourself, which is sometimes needed 
to make certain fields work. An example:

```
{
    id: "arrivalDate",
    label: "Arrival",
    type: "calendar",
    cast: {
        data: (value) => new Date(value),
        field: (value) => String(value).split("T")[0]
    }
}
```

For non callback options, all JS proimitive types are available, so `number`, `string` and `boolean`. Additionally, `date` can 
be used to convert between Date objects and strings.

Finally, for fields which expect arrays, you can do something like this:

```
{
    id: "eventDates",
    label: "Event Dates",
    type: "multiselect",
    cast: {
        data: ["string"],
        field: ["date"]
    }
}
```
