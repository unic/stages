# Custom Errors

Every field comes with a simple error renderer, mostly just checking if a required field was filled out. Ideally 
you want to be more precise than just showing "Please fill out this field!" as the default error renderrer does. This 
is where custom errors are useful. You can set them up like this (using some Bootstrap for the formatting):

```
import Form from 'react-bootstrap/Form';

const FieldError = ({ customText }) => (
  <Form.Control.Feedback type="invalid">
    {customText || "Please fill out this field!"}
  </Form.Control.Feedback>
);
```

And than later in the form config:

```
{
    id: "email",
    label: "Email",
    type: "email",
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, isValid }) => {
        return; // Add your huge custom email validation regex here!
    },
    errorRenderer: (error) => FieldError({ customText: "Please enter a valid email address." }),
}
```
