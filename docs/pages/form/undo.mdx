# Undo / Redo

You can activate undo / redo functionality for a form, all you have to set is `enableUndo` on the Form component. 
Optionally you can set the depth of the undo memory, which is done with the `undoMaxDepth` prop, per default 
it is set to 10.

Here's a basic example of using undo:

```
<Form
    enableUndo
    fields={yourFields}
    config={youFieldsConfig}
    render={({ actionProps, fieldProps }) => (
        <>
            <div>
                {fieldProps.fields.email}
                <br />
                {fieldProps.fields.password}
            </div>
            <hr />
            <button
                type="button"
                onClick={() => actionProps.handleActionClick(payload => console.log("onSubmit:", payload), true)}
            >
                Submit
            </button>
            <br />
            <button onClick={actionProps.handleUndo}>Undo</button>
            <button onClick={actionProps.handleRedo}>Redo</button>
        </>
    )}
/>
```

On the `actionProps` in the render function, you have the necessary callbacks, `handleUndo` and `handleRedo` which you have to call, 
for example with buttons as in the sample code above.
