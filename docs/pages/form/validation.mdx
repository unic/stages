# Validation

Each field in a form can have two types of validation. The first one is based on the field type 
and comes with the included field set. All it normally does is check if a required field is filled 
out. Here's an example of such a type validation for plain Input fields:

```
const isValid = (value, config) => {
    if (config.isRequired && (value === "" || typeof value === "undefined")) return false;
    return true;
};
```

More complicated field types can have more complicated default validations, for example a date range 
field would validate that the "from date" is before the "to date".

Additionally, you can validate on a per field basis, using the `customValidation` property in a field config. 
This could look soemthing like this:

```
{
    id: "username",
    label: "Username",
    type: "text",
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, isValid }) => {
        return isValid && data.replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/gi, "") === data;
    },
    errorRenderer: (error) => <div style={{ color: "#f30" }}><br />Please fill out this field. Only alphanumeric values and '-' is allowed.</div>,
}
```

The `isValid` variable in the `customValidation` function tells you what the type based validation of the field returns, which 
means you don't have to check for the `isRequired` property again.

You get following variables in the `customValidation` function:

- **data**: The data of this specific field
- **allData**: All the data of the form
- **fieldConfig**: The configuration for the field
- **isValid**: The default type based validation (a boolean)
