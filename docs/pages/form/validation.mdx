# Validation

Each field in a form can have two types of validation. The first one is based on the field type 
and comes with the included field set. All it normally does is check if a required field is filled 
out. Here's an example of such a type validation for plain Input fields:

```
const isValid = (value, config) => {
    if (config.isRequired && (value === "" || typeof value === "undefined")) return false;
    return true;
};
```

More complicated field types can have more complicated default validations, for example a date range 
field would validate that the "from date" is before the "to date".

Additionally, you can validate on a per field basis, using the `customValidation` property in a field config. 
This could look soemthing like this:

```
{
    id: "username",
    label: "Username",
    type: "text",
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, isValid }) => {
        return isValid && data.replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/gi, "") === data;
    },
    errorRenderer: (error) => <div style={{ color: "#f30" }}><br />Please fill out this field. Only alphanumeric values and '-' is allowed.</div>,
}
```

The above mentioned date range custom validation:

```
{
    id: 'fromDate',
    label: "From",
    type: 'date',
    isRequired: true
},
{
    id: 'toDate',
    label: "To",
    type: 'date',
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, allData, fieldConfig, isValid }) => {
        if (allData.fromDate && data) {
            const fromDate = new Date(allData.fromDate);
            const toDate = new Date(data);
            // Make sure fromDate isn't bigger than toDate:
            if (fromDate > toDate) return false;
        }
        return isValid;
    }
}
```

The `isValid` variable in the `customValidation` function tells you what the type based validation of the field returns, which 
means you don't have to check for the `isRequired` property again.

You get following variables in the `customValidation` function:

- **data**: The data of this specific field
- **allData**: All the data of the form
- **fieldConfig**: The configuration for the field
- **isValid**: The default type based validation (a boolean)

## Validation Events

Per default, validation happens on actions which have validation switched on, eq:

```
actionProps.handleActionClick(onSubmit, true);
```

But you can set it up however you want, using the `validateOn` property on the Form component, which accepts an array of event types.

```
<Form
    validateOn={["action", "blur"]}
    ...
/>
```

You have following options:

- **action**: This is the default, validation on form actions
- **blur**: This probably is the second most used, validation on input blur (or click on elemnts that don't support blur)
- **change**: This is the most busy, validating on every change of the fields values
- **collectionAction**: And this one validates on collection actions, like add or delete an entry

Additionally, you can set this behaviour on each field individually, like this:

```
{
    id: "password",
    label: "Password",
    type: "password",
    validateOn: ["change"]
}
```

Which can be very useful for things like the password feild above, if you want dynamically show how save it is and if it's save enough.
