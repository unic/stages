# Validation

Each field in a form can have two types of validation. The first one is based on the field type 
and comes with the included field set. All it normally does is check if a required field is filled 
out. Here's an example of such a type validation for plain Input fields:

```
const isValid = (value, config) => {
    if (config.isRequired && (value === "" || typeof value === "undefined")) return false;
    return true;
};
```

More complicated field types can have more complicated default validations, for example a date range 
field would validate that the "from date" is before the "to date".

Additionally, you can validate on a per field basis, using the `customValidation` property in a field config. 
This could look soemthing like this:

```
{
    id: "username",
    label: "Username",
    type: "text",
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, isValid }) => {
        return isValid && data.replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/gi, "") === data;
    },
    errorRenderer: (error) => <div style={{ color: "#f30" }}><br />Please fill out this field. Only alphanumeric values and '-' is allowed.</div>,
}
```

The above mentioned date range custom validation:

```
{
    id: 'fromDate',
    label: "From",
    type: 'date',
    isRequired: true
},
{
    id: 'toDate',
    label: "To",
    type: 'date',
    isRequired: true,
    customValidation: ({ data, allData, fieldConfig, isValid, isDirty }) => {
        if (allData.fromDate && data) {
            const fromDate = new Date(allData.fromDate);
            const toDate = new Date(data);
            // Make sure fromDate isn't bigger than toDate:
            if (fromDate > toDate) return false;
        }
        return isValid;
    }
}
```

The `isValid` variable in the `customValidation` function tells you what the type based validation of the field returns, which 
means you don't have to check for the `isRequired` property again.

You get following variables in the `customValidation` function:

- **data**: The data of this specific field
- **allData**: All the data of the form
- **fieldConfig**: The configuration for the field
- **isValid**: The default type based validation (a boolean)
- **isDirty**: In case you only want to validate dirty fields (a boolean)

## Validation Events

Per default, validation happens on actions which have validation switched on, eq:

```
actionProps.handleActionClick(onSubmit, true);
```

But you can set it up however you want, using the `validateOn` property on the Form component, which accepts an array of event types.

```
<Form
    validateOn={["action", "blur"]}
    ...
/>
```

You have following options:

- **action**: This is the default, validation on form actions
- **blur**: This probably is the second most used, validation on input blur (or click on elemnts that don't support blur)
- **change**: This is the most busy, validating on every change of the fields values
- **throttledChange**: This is a throttled version of the change event (default: 400ms). To change the default, use the `throttleWait` property on the Form component.
- **collectionAction**: And this one validates on collection actions, like add or delete an entry

Additionally, you can set this behaviour on each field individually, like this:

```
{
    id: "password",
    label: "Password",
    type: "password",
    validateOn: ["change"]
}
```

Which can be very useful for things like the password field above, if you want dynamically show how save it is and if it's save enough.

And for really complex validation behaviour, you can use a callaback to decide when to validate:

```
{
    id: "dynamicValidate",
    label: "Valid on even length (2, 4, 6 ...)",
    type: "text",
    isRequired: true,
    validateOn: ({ data, fieldIsDirty, fieldConfig }) => {
        return data && data.length > 5 ? ["change", "blur", "action"] : ["blur", "action"];
    },
    customValidation: ({ data, allData, isValid }) => {
        if (isValid && data.length % 2 === 1) return "UNEVEN";
        return isValid;
    }
}
```
