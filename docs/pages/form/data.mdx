# Data

Stages can handle deeply nested data structures and arrays. Internally it uses a flat data structure and 
Lodash paths to loop through and access all the fields and data. A path can look something like this:

```group1.mylist[2].field1```

Here we first have a field with the id `group1` which is of type group. The field would be defined like this:

```
{
    id: "group1",
    type: "group",
    fields: [...]
}
```

The second part of the path is an array like collection, which is defined like this:

```
{
    id: "group1",
    type: "group",
    fields: [
        {
            id: "mylist",
            type: "collection",
            fields: [...]
        }    
    ]
}
```

And lastly, we have a regular input field inside the collection, which is defined like this:

```
{
    id: "group1",
    type: "group",
    fields: [
        {
            id: "mylist",
            type: "collection",
            fields: [
                {
                    id: "field1",
                    type: "text",
                    label: "Field 1"
                }
            ]
        }    
    ]
}
```

The resulting data from this form could than look like this:

```
{
    group1: {
        mylist: [
            { field1: "Example input 1" },
            { field1: "Example input 2" },
            { field1: "Example input 3" }
        ]
    }
}
```

Because accessing deeply nested data is so integral to Stages, for example in a custom validation, 
we expose the `Lodash` `get` method directly from the library:

```import { get } from "react-stages":```
