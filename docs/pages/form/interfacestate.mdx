# Interface State

Sometimes you want to use form elements purely for interface state. For example a 
checkbox which opens advanced options or a computed value which is purely to inform 
the user, for example about the sum of the entered values.

Telling stages what form field is interface state is very simple:

```
{
    id: "advanced",
    label: "Advanced Options:",
    type: "checkbox",
    isInterfaceState: true
}
```

This way the value of `advanced` will not be added to data, but just to the internal interface 
state. You can than for example use the value in the render prop to hide all the advanced 
options like this:

```
{fieldProps.interfaceState.advanced ? (
    <div>{fieldProps.fields.advancedoption}</div>
) : null}
```

Interface state can be initialized on the form like this:

```
<Form
    initialInterfaceState={{ advanced: true }}
    ...
/>
```

And if you want to remember the last interface state, it is available on the onChange 
callback of the form:

```
<Form
    onChange={(data, errors, id, fieldKey, interfaceState) => {
        setData(data);
        saveInterfaceState(interfaceState);
    }}
    ...
/>
```

Unlike the data prop, it is only read on init, so not connected data, you can't constantly 
update it from outside.
