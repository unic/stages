# Stages

Let's have a closer look at the props for Stages and the children render prop.

Stages itself has following props:

- **initialData**: You can prefill the wizard with data using this prop
- **initialStep**: As with the data, you can set which step should be displayed initially
- **render**: Here you define how the wizard is rendered
- **validateOnStepChange**: For debugging purposes it is sometimes usefull to disable validation on step change
- **onChange**: Listen to data changes by adding a function here

Each child is given a bunch of render props, these are:

- **data**: The current step data
- **allData**: Data from all steps
- **onChange**: Change handler to connect the Form with the Wizard component
- **onNav**: A function to call to trigger a step navigation (can be declined if step isn't valid)
- **isActive**: Is this the currently active step?
- **index**: The step index, counted from zero
- **errors**: All the validation errors
- **setStepKey**: A function you should call initially to set the step key
- **initializing**: This is true while Stages is initializing and gathering all the step keys

Let's analyse a single Stages child on it's own:

```
<Stages
    ...
>
    {({ data, allData, isActive, onChange, onNav, index, errors, setStepKey, initializing }) => {
        const key = setStepKey("basics", index);
        if (initializing) return null;

        return (
            <Fragment key={`step-${key}`}>
                {isActive ? <h2>Basics:</h2> : null}
                <Form
                    id={key}
                    data={data}
                    onChange={onChange}
                    isVisible={isActive}
                    ...
                />
            </Fragment>
        );
    }}
</Stages>
```

After desctructuring all the render props, this is the first line:

```
const key = setStepKey("basics", index);
```

What this line does, is set the step key, `basics` in this case. This will be used for the route hash if you're using a router, and 
the it will be used as the key which groups all the data collected in this step. So data could look something like this:

```
{
    basics: {
        projectName: "Test",
        dueDate: "2022-12-12"
    }
}
```

And the url could look like this while you're on this step (if you use the Hashrouter with its default settings):

```
https://mydomain.com/mywizard#!basics
```

The second line inside the child:

```
if (initializing) return null;
```

This makes sure, that the form is not rendered during the initialization phase.

And finally we return our rendered form, where we connect the data and handlers so that it can be controlled by Stages:

```
return (
    <Fragment key={`step-${key}`}>
        {isActive ? <h2>Basics:</h2> : null}
        <Form
            id={key}
            data={data}
            onChange={onChange}
            isVisible={isActive}
            ...
        />
    </Fragment>
);
```

We use the `isActive` prop to hide the headline. Don't hide the whole form, or data will not be validated while the step is invisible.

Btw, you don't have to render a form in a step. You can regular markup, as well. This can be usefull for example if you have 
a summary step at the end of your wizard, where data is only nicely summaries, but no data input happens. Here's an example of 
such a step:

```
{({ data, allData, isActive, onChange, onNav, index, errors, setStepKey, initializing }) => {
    const key = setStepKey("empty", index);
    if (initializing) return null;

    if (!isActive) return <Fragment key={`step-${key}`}></Fragment>;

    // Validate this step on mount by adding random data to this steps data:
    if (!data || Object.keys(data).length === 0) onChange({visited: true}, {}, index);

    return (
        <div key={`step-${key}`}>
            <h2>An empty Step</h2>
            <p>You don't need to put froms on a step!</p>
            <button type="button" onClick={() => onNav("prev")}>Prev</button>
            <button type="button" onClick={() => onNav("next")}>Next</button>
        </div>
    );
}}
```

Notice that we still return an empty fragment if the step is inactive. This is needed, otherwise React throws an error.
And to make sure Stages knows that the step has been visited, we set some dummy data on this step:

```
if (!data || Object.keys(data).length === 0) onChange({visited: true}, {}, index);
```

This makes sure that the last valid step is the correct one.
