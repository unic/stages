# Routing

Stages comes with a default hash router. It's fully optional. Stages can function without a router, or 
you can add your own router if you like.

The router is added inside the render prop like this:

```
<Stages
    render={({ navigationProps, progressionProps, routerProps, steps }) => (
        <div>
            ...
            {typeof window !== "undefined" ? <HashRouter {...routerProps} /> : null}
        </div>
    )}
>
    ...
</Stages>
```

Additionally to the mapped `routerProps`, you can set:

- **prefix**: A hash prefix, for example if you want the word step in front of the step key: `#!step-basisc`
- **hashFormat**: Per default, the Hashrouter will use a hasbang like this: `#!`

Definitely check out the source code of the default hash router if you want to use your own routing solution, or if you want 
to make it work inside an app that is already using hash routing.
