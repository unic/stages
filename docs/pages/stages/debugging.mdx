# Debugging

Debugging a big wizard, with multiple steps can be tireome. Entering the data again and again, just to get to that last step where 
you had an error isn't a nice developing experience. This is why we added features to make working on a specific step easier. More 
debugging features will follow.

What we do first, is force the wizard to a certain step and disable validation on step changes:

```
<Stages
    initialStep={3}
    validateOnStepChange={false}
    ...
>
    ...
</Stages>
```

Additionally you can add initial data which helps you debug the specific step:

```
<Stages
    initialData={{
        step3: {
            someField: "Test data ...",
            someOtherField: "Bla, bla ..."
        }
    }}
    initialStep={3}
    validateOnStepChange={false}
    ...
>
    ...
</Stages>
```

This is of course helpful in automated test, as well. Just make sure that you run your interface tests after Stages has initialized.

## Debugger Component

Stages comes with a componnet which helps you debug things. Use it like this:

```
import { Debugger } from "./lib/stages";

...

return (
    <>
        <Form ... />
        <Debugger />
    </>
);

```
