# Architecture

Stages consists of two main components, `Stages` and `Form`. The philosophy of Stages is to not 
render any markup, that is your job. Stages handles all the complicated stuff like validation for you, 
but you have to bring your own markup and styles and field components. This assures 100% flexibility, 
but it takes a little bit more effort initially when setting up your project.
